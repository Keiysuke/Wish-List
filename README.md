# Wish-List
Website to manage your purchases and sells.
Done with laravel 8 and Tailwind.

This website will help you recover all the purchases/and sells you made with time.
As it's not automatically adding products/purchases from other websites, you'll have to add the products and other datas by yourself.

New functionalities :
- Add possibility to create "Crowdfundings" (product/website) and access the project's webpage from it
- New section "Crowdfundings" on product's detailed page

Here are the current functionnalities (see upside for last ones) :
- Add 2 searches in sidebar for books & on products' page which are tagged as "Livre"
- Reminder pages for Design-system / PSR / Example codings
- New notitications (missing photos on product, video game without associated product)
- Photo is no more necessary to create a product
- Add search icon on products pages to find some pictures on Google
- Register/Log in website
- Add Products - Creating new product with minimum datas (name, price, description)
- Link websites to a product - You can buy the product on a website ? Link it !
- Add purchases - You bought a product ? You can save the purchase by creating one on the product page.
- Add sells - Create as many purchases as you want and if you're selling a product, switch the purchase by clicking on it and link a new sell.
- Manage datas with the Dashboard - Add new websites / product states / sell states
- Follow a product created by other users and link purchases/sells - You can't edit that kind of product
- Follow a product and be notified when some of its offers are soon available/expired (from 3 to 0 days before).
- Create your own lists (wish, purchases) and add products (multiple copy if needed) - Global cost for all the products is visible from a list.
- You have to go on a product to add it to a previously created list.
- You purchased multiple products at once ? - Create a grouped purchase, link each purchase (previously or automatically created) for each product.
- Go to "My products / My purchases" - You'll have a look of all your previous purchases/sells - Grouped purchases have a slightly different look.
