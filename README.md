# Wish-List
Website to manage your purchases and sells.
Done with laravel 8 and Tailwind.

This website will help you recover all the purchases/and sells you made with time.
As it's not automatically adding products/purchases from other websites, you'll have to add the products and other datas by yourself.

New functionalities :
- Update/Delete your grouped purchases - Plus you can delete selected purchase from a "grouped purchase" when editing one.
- You can now filter on an entered period when visualizing your historic of purchases/sellings.
- You can now set a customs price for any of your purchase.

Here are the current functionnalities (see upside for last ones) :
- Register/Log in website
- Add Products - Creating new product with minimum datas (name, price, description, at least one photo)
- Link websites to a product - You can buy the product on a website ? Link it !
- Add purchases - You bought a product ? You can save the purchase by creating one on the product page.
- Add sells - Create as many purchases as you want and if you're selling a product, switch the purchase by clicking on it and link a new sell.
- Manage datas with the Dashboard - Add new websites / product states / sell states
- Follow a product created by other users and link purchases/sells - You can't edit that kind of product
- Follow a product and be notified when some of its offers are soon available/expired (from 3 to 0 days before).
Last ones were : 
- Create your own lists (wish, purchases) and add products (multiple copy if needed) - Global cost for all the products is visible from a list.
- You have to go on a product to add it to a previously created list.
- You purchased multiple products at once ? - Create a grouped purchase, link each purchase (previously or automatically created) for each product.
- Go to "My products / My purchases" - You'll have a look of all your previous purchases/sells - Grouped purchases have a slightly different look.

And more :
- Add up to 10 pictures on a product. Zoom on them.
- Add available/expired dates on a linked website to see it on the product list page (Home page).
- See all products on Home page and filter or search by text to see only what you're looking for.
- Pagination available on Home page with at least 16 products.
- Get notified when a product's offer will soon expire/be available.

In future
- Notification for sells informations maybe too.
- Add other users as friend and tchat with them.
- Share lists with friends for future present bought (anniversary ? Christmas ?).
